I decided with a Impressionism Art Gallery website because I wanted to make a artistic design to match the background animation that I planned on making, which was the rotating gradient circles. Originally, I planned on making a colorful background as well, but in the end, I liked how the white color made it look a little more modern. I implemented the transition features to the artworks, text, navigation links, and the animated background. For the CSS animation, I decided on the background animation with moving shapes. I implemented the use of variables, mixins, and nesting. I used a variable for the gradient color of the circles and the mixins for three animations. I also used nesting to organize my code. In order to ensure my website was responsive, I used percentages for the size of certain elements.
